# EuroSat
It consists of 27000 labelled Sentinel-2 satellite images of different land uses: residential, industrial, highway, river, forest, pasture, herbaceous vegetation, annual crop, permanent crop and sea/lake. For a reference, see the following papers:  Eurosat: A novel dataset and deep learning benchmark for land use and land cover classification.

Introducing EuroSAT: A Novel Dataset and Deep Learning Benchmark for Land Use and Land Cover Classification. Patrick Helber, Benjamin Bischke, Andreas Dengel. 2018 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium, 2018. 

The goal is to construct a neural network that classifies a satellite image into one of these 10 classes, as well as applying some of the saving and loading techniques you have learned in the previous sessions.
